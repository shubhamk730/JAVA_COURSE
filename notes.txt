How JAVA Works:
    -> With JVM (Works on hardware and OS).
    -> JVM is not independent, application is independent
    -> JVM executes a byte code.
    -> We write high level language (JAVA code).
    -> javac compiles code into byte code.
    -> First file needs to have main method.
    -> looks for "public static void main(String a[])" signature.

Data Types
    -> primitive -> Integer(byte, short, int, long)
                 -> float(4 bytes), double(8 bytes) (double is default in java)
                 -> character (UNICODE characters, not ASCII)
                 -> boolean (Only true and false, not 0 and 1)
    * after every long variable value put l, and float variable value put f.
    -> Non primitive -> Array
